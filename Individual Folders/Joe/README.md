- Animation work in progress. Shbeeb actually recommended I should mess around with a lower poly model first. I'm going to try and go for it from the get go, 
hopefully no issues. If anything comes up I will let you know.

Class Schedule: M/W 10:30-12:20
                          T/Th  8:30-10:20 1:30:-3:20

Outside of those times I try to get my work done as best I can. T/Th are the days where I have a dedicated break in between class to do work.
